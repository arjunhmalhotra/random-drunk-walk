# random-drunk-walk
The program simulates a drunkard's escape from a building (a random walk within a circle with a hole in the side of radius 30 degree). The program returns a printed output if the random walk permits him to escape the enclosure or not. We limit the program to 1000 steps so that the random walk doesn't go on for too long.
